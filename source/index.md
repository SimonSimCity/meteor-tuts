<h1>Hello and Welcome!</h1>

First of all, welcome aboard and congratulations on your choice of embarking on this journey. But before we start, let me tell you a little story:</br>
As years passed by and humanity evolved, apps have literally changed the way in which the world works, giving us the chance to simplify and optimize many aspects of our lives.
Having things simplified gave us more time, time which we, as humans started to use smartly by finding a way so simplify the process of building apps.
As a result of those efforts MeteorJS was born.

**Important!**
To further help your understanding we have set a [github repository](http://www.github.com) where you can find a branch for each of the sections
you will complete on this tutorial.
In addition to this tutorial you can watch every section of it online [on our youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com). These videos will contain a more detailed explanation
given by your trainer in order for you to better understand the concepts you are learning.



<h1>What is Meteor?</h1>

Meteor is an open-source JavaScript-based framework which allows the developing of complex web and mobile apps at a fast pace.
The frameworkâ€™s design is based on simplicity and efficiency, thus making it a good fit for both beginner and advanced developers.



<h1>What is Cult of Coders?</h1>

We are a Romanian company solely focused on web and mobile development. Analyzing our clients needs we understood that what
they are looking for in a product is a perfect combination of the newest technologies and fastness, stability and scalability.
 In order to apply to all those needs and become more professional we chose to work exclusively with Meteor and React.
 
 
<h1>What is Meteor-Tuts?</h1>

Being in love with what we do we contributed to a series of open-source projects which you can see [HERE](http://www.github.com/cult-of-coders).</br>0
Meteor-Tuts is one of the projects closest to our hearts designed as a useful tool for any programmer that wants to step up his/her game.
Navigating through this complex but rather easy to understand tutorial you will be accompanied by video tutorials for each chapter and sub-chapter.
Also, to give you an even better overview, we will provide you with a github repository link where you can find the full project 
although we recommend you to take it step by step in order to achieve a better understanding and mastery of the MeteorJS framework.


<h1>Before you begin</h1>

This tutorial is focused on Meteor, which is a Javascript framework.
Because we want to teach you Meteor, we will already assume you know Javascript ES6, in order to keep this tutorial focused.

However, if you do need to learn Javascript, you can use these resources:
- We recommend this [website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), because it will help you get some experience, after you're
 done with the Javascript, HTML and CSS tutorials.
- One of the most eloquent [Javascript tutorials](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) on the web.
- A [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) from the 
Mozilla Foundation ( yes, they do maintain the Firefox browser :)).

If you are familiar with Javascript, but not with the ES6 syntax, you can use these resources to learn it:
- To just learn the syntax, this is the [place](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html) to go to. 
- After you've learned the syntax of ES6, to get some practice, go [here](http://es6katas.org/). 

These resources are ordered in the order we thought wold serve you best to go over them. If you think you have found a 
better way to learn Javascript ES6, then, by all means, please use the resource which fits you better. 

Even though our primarily focus is Meteor, we are going to use React so that you can visualize how everything works, which is the view layer we recommend for Meteor. Ideally, would be to study first React even though our primary focus on this tutorial is Meteor. To study React, we recommend you:
