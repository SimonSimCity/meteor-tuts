<h1>Hi there!</h1>

We are Cult of Coders, a company which focuses on developing the best possible web applications.
We only work with Meteor, we absolutely love it, and we'd like to teach you how to use it.

During the last few years we've gathered a lot of experience, and we'd like to share that experience with you.
Meteor has changed a lot, and is now fully packed with lots of cool stuff that will enable you to create both
simple and complex enterprise-level applications.

This tutorial is structured in chapters, which are made up of lessons.

We encourage you to follow along in a practical manner. This way, you will encounter problems, and learn more.
Also, the information will come back to you a lot easier when you work on projects!
You can find a pre-installed meteor project having the chapter 1 & 2 examples that you can test on your own machine, on our [Github Repository](https://github.com/cult-of-coders/meteor-tuts-boilerplate)

<h1>Before you begin</h1>

This tutorial is focused on Meteor, which is a Javascript framework.
Because we want to teach you Meteor, we will already assume you know Javascript ES6, in order to keep this tutorial focused.

However, if you do need to learn Javascript, you can use these resources:
- We recommend this [website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), because it will help you get some experience, after you're
 done with the Javascript, HTML and CSS tutorials.
- One of the most eloquent [Javascript tutorials](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) on the web.
- A [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) from the 
Mozilla Foundation ( yes, they do maintain the Firefox browser :)).

If you are familiar with Javascript, but not with the ES6 syntax, you can use these resources to learn it:
- To just learn the syntax, this is the [place](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html) to go to. 
- After you've learned the syntax of ES6, to get some practice, go [here](http://es6katas.org/). 

These resources are ordered in the order we thought wold serve you best to go over them. If you think you have found a 
better way to learn Javascript ES6, then, by all means, please use the resource which fits you better. 

All of the resources linked in here are free to use. Because of this, you will only need a computer with an internet 
connection and time.

<h1>Compatibility warning</h1>

Due to the fact that some differences in the steps described in this tutorial might occur, depending on the platform 
that you are using ( Windows, Mac or Linux ), we will address these particularities separately, where they are encountered.

<h1>Using the terminal</h1>

Throughout this tutorial, we will be using the command line interface extensively. 
To help you out, here are instructions that should enable you to perform some basic operations in the command line interface:

![Linux](../images/tuxSmall.png "Linux icon")

Bash is the default command line interface on most of the Linux distributions out there. 
Usually, the shortcut to launch the terminal is Ctrl+Alt+T.
To insert copied content into the terminal, use the shortcut Shift+Insert, or right click inside the window and click 
on the "Paste" option from the menu that appears. 
To find out more information regarding the usage of the command line interface on Linux, go [here](http://linuxcommand.org/). 

![Windows](../images/windowsSmall.png "Windows icon")

On Windows, there are 2 options available for you: CMD and PowerShell.
Search for either of these in the Start menu and launch it with a click.
To insert copied content into either of the programs, right click inside the window and the content from your clipboard will be pasted into the window.
To learn how to use CMD effectively, go [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490890.aspx). 
For PowerShell, this is the official [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/core-powershell/console/powershell.exe-command-line-help?view=powershell-5.1).

![OSX](../images/OSXsmall.png "OSX icon")

Mac users can rely on iTerm if they need to use a command line interface.
To launch iTerm on OSX, either search for the application in the menu, or use the shortcut Command+T.
To insert copied content into iTerm, use the shortcut Command+v, or, from the "Edit" menu, choose the option "Paste".
To learn more about using iTerm to its fullest potential, go [here](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation.html).
 
Congratulations on finishing the introduction to this tutorial !
Now you can move on, to the Meteor-related content of this tutorial.
